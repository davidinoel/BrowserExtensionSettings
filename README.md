I'm always looking for business partners to assist in building out my never-ending list of projects, so if anything you find here strikes you as a fairly good idea--keeping in mind that these are the freebies I'm giving out publicly--and you have any interest in more profitable projects, please feel free to get in touch. I also freelance, have experience in most areas of business, and am open to remote consulting opportunities.
